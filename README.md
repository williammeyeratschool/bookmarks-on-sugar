bookmarks on sugar.

<p> This is a project where I make a barebones homepage. </p>
<br>
<p> theres not anything to it. </p>

<h3> Why is this forked? </h3>
<p> I literally have the password any everything for the last account but my school somehow broke the github api to where its literally impossible to use it and due to that and the outlook account getting locked I have lost access to that account. </p>
<p> update: I know how to but im to lazy </p>
<p> update 2.0: even if I did I wouldnt have access to the ema- oh wait I dont have access to the email to this account this is gonna repeat next year </p>
